<p>Go play candy box after this! Its another ascii game and its really cool what that guy did. It inspired me to make this.

Also the game A Dark Room was another inspiration. Very fun one.

Also check out these websites. Some of the art in this game comes from them. Thats right I didn't do it all myself. I have a life... kinda.
